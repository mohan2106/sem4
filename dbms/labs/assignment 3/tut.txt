1). RUN THIS COMMAND IN YOUR TERMINAL IF NOT DONE BEFORE
    $ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
    //above command will install header files needed to connet your c/c++ file with mysql
2). NOW USE YOUR PREVIOUS LAB SQL FILE TO CREATE NEW DATABASE AND LOAD DATAINTO THAT **(DON'T CREATE PROCEDURE, YOU ONLY HAVE TO LOAD DATA INTO THREE TABLES)**
3). NOW ADD sample.cpp and sample1.cpp FILE SHARED BY LORD __ IN YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY
4). (read point 5 before changing this**) MAKE SOME APPROPRIATE CHANGES LIKE CHANGE DB_NAME,USER_NAME,USER_PASSWORD AND QUERY VARIABLES AS PER YOUR DATABASE
    YOUR DATABASE TABLES MAY HAVE TABLES WITH DIFFERENT NAME OR DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTE NAME SO CHANGE IT AS PER YOUR DATABASE
4.1). IF YOU DONT KNOW YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD THAN USE GOOGLE AND SEARCH ABOUT HOW TO CREATE USER IN SQL AND MAKE A NEW USER.
5). ALTERNATE WAY OF DOING POINT 4 IS YOU CAN JUST COPY THE QUERY USED IN PROCEDURE IN LAST LAB QUES AND REPLACE IT IN THE NEW CPP FILE
6). NOW YOU ARE DONE WITH THE CPP FILE, 
    WONDER, HOW TO COMILE THE CPP FILE?
    DON'T WORRY I AM HERE TO HELP YOU:)
    RUN THIS COMMAND IN THE TERMINAL
        $ g++ sample.cpp $(mysql_config --include --libs)  //(mysql_config --inclde --libs) stores the address of header file used in our file
        $ ./a.out
    IF YOU KNOW HOW TO WRITE MAKEFILES THAN I RECOMMEND YOU TO WRITE THAT OTHER WISE ABOVE WILL ALSO WORK
7). BRAVO YOU ARE DONE :)


8). DON'T COPY EXACT FILE, SAVE YOU AND ME. YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH TO PREVENT TO FROM PLAGRISM MATCH, DO IT :)
